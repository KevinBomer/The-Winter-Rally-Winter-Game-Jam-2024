    #NARRATOR FADE IN:
label act2:
    "Believe it or not, Finn's living space was in surprisingly good shape for a struggling college student."
    "Really nice place. Not a single cup, can or bottle in sight."
    "Well, in the common area, at least. Who knew what things were hiding on the other side of the door?
    All three of us were hoping we'd be able to find out. As long as Finn was all ears, of course."
    ter "Guys, what if he's just ignoring us?"
    morg "You simply keep knocking until he can't ignore it anymore."
    ter "Believe me, you give that man a thick textbook and a pair of headphones and he could miss the end of the world."
    ter "Love that guy, personally, but I wouldn't put it past him."
    ter "Unless, maybe..."
    ter "PIZZA'S HERE, DUDE!"

    #Enter FINN
    fin "I did inform you I would be occupied."
    ter "Good to see you too, Finn!"
    ter "What are we studyin' today? A dash of Chem? Some Bio? A bit of both?"
    fin "Well, you see, I {i}could{/i} be, however…"
    ter "Hey, don't give me that pointer finger!"
    fin "I apologize."
    fin "I really doubt any of you could comprehend the sheer magnitude of work I’m doing right now."
    fin "Examinations and such, if you remember how those felt."
    ter "Oh, c'mon, Finn, is there anything you don't know at this point?"
    ter "Just remember that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell and then you're golden!"
    fin "Actually, the mitochondria produces ATP as a means of storing chemical potential—"
    ter "SEE?! That's exactly my point! You're good! You're done for the day!"
    #enter MORGAN from LEFT
    morg "Terr's right. Live a little."
    #tense beat
    fin "Morgan."
    fin "You're looking... spirited."
    morg "Likewise."
    "Awkward silence fills the room."
    fin "I can’t afford any distractions."
    fin "My major examination is mere days away, and I can't afford to waste even a second outside of my allotted breaks."
    morg "Your breaks of... what, ten minutes each, I'm guessing?"
    ter "Yeah, that's gonna fry your brain no matter how ya look at it! You need some'a that crisp winter air in your lungs."
    ter "Which you definitely shoulda known, mister doctor."
    menu:
        "So, what, you don't do friends anymore?":
            jump coldshoulder
        "We’ll study with you, then.":
            jump studydate
label coldshoulder:
    fin "Not during work hours, as has been the case since high school, anyway!"
    fin "If you all are so desperate for my company, try waiting several hours!"
label studydate:
    fin "Would you {i}really?{/i} On the one day you all have the time for each other?"
    ter "And for you, Finn. That always includes you."
label finnlament:
    fin "...Even with everything said and done, it's far from that simple, I fear."
    fin "Morgan. Think back to your initial diagnosis."
    fin "How rare did they tell you it was to encounter a tumor of the heart?"
    #beat
    morg "Unfathomably rare."
    fin "Nearly a thousandth of a percent. A {i}thousandth.{/i} It's totally not fair."
    morg "As I've come to accept these past few months, yes."
    fin "But {i}I{/i} can't accept it!"
    fin "If you hold on and your condition stays stable for a while longer, and I remain on track with my studies... I can aid you."
    fin "And if not you, then whomever else in need!"
    morg "I've held on long enough, Finn."
    morg "Today, the best cure you can give me is a day of your time."
    fin "After which I shall still need to study... and you will still remain sickly."
    ter "Oh, for God's sake, Finn, this girl stood up for the first time in months to come say hi to us!"
    ter "You should have seen it! Or is it gonna take more to convince you, huh?"
    #MINIGAME START

    #SUCCESS
    fin "Alright, I yield."
    #TERRIE and MORGAN sigh with relief
    fin "How opportune is this line-up of friends outside my door, indeed?"
    fin "Once more, I apologize. To you especially, Morgan."
    fin "It's good to see you again."
    morg "Likewise. Don't sweat it, mister doctor."
    fin "So. Now that the doctor is metaphorically “in,” I suppose it's time to recount the grand agenda."
    fin "Which we can find on Morgan's, uh..."
    morg "My bucket list! Congratulations on being the first item of order, by the way."
    fin "Hooray?"
    morg "Of course hooray. Now, you were awfully quick to open the door at the promise of pizza."
    fin "A lot of time has passed since my last meal. Why do you ask?"
    ter "Well, we all know how being hangry can—"
    "Finn's stomach audibly growls."
    fin "Ah."
    ter "We can do you one better than pizza, though. Remember Miya's?"
    fin "The petite little sushi establishment. Of course..."
    fin "That'll do. That'll do nicely."
    fin "The holidays have definitely imbued you with nostalgic joy, eh, Morgan?"
    "Morgan's smile turns Knowingly Melancholic."
    morg "What can I say, it's a time for family..."
    ter "Couldn't have said it better myself, guys!"
    ter "What are we waiting for, then?! Item Two: Eat a Meal Worth Dying For!"
    ter "Miya's here we come!"
    #EXIT TERRIE at left
    fin "By the way, Morgan, about your sudden need to come and visit…"
    #beat
    fin "Mina didn't put you up to this, did she?"
    morg "Oh, you wish."
    #FAILURE
    fin "We're going round in circles here." 
    fin "You want me to engage in a day of folly, but I want to hold tight for the better part of a week to secure my entire future." 
    fin "Are there any other observations you have yet to make clear to me yet?" 
    ter "How about we just care a lot and wanna see you outside your room for a change?!" 
    fin "You're doing it again..." 
    ter "Alright, fine, then it's because you stink of old books and party pooping and freshening up would do miracles for you!" 
    fin "Oh, don't be so puerile." 
    ter "Finn—"
    ter "Okay. Okay." 
    morg "If you won't listen to us then just make a decision yourself." 
    morg "Finn, are you coming with us or not?" 
    #Tense pause. 
    fin "I want..."
    morg "Yes?"
    fin "...for you to get back in contact with me in a few days' time." 
    "Terrie groans, and Morgan's face SINKS." 
    finn "I believe that compromise will satisfy both worlds." 
    fin "Now, it's been lovely to see you all again, and I really mean that, but I don't want to imagine what a failure at this level could mean." 
    fin "I look forward to the next few days." 
    fin "Bye-bye, all." 
    ter "But Finn, we don't HAVE—"
    #Fade out Finn, with the door shutting again. 
    morg "No..."
    ter "Man." 
    ter "Was this guy always such a jerk, or does Med school just do that to you?" 
    ter "I swear, I'll bust down that door n' carry him out myself if it means you—" 
    morg "Please don't." 
    morg "We can't afford to lose any friendships anymore." 
    morg "Let's just try to enjoy our day." 
    ter "Alright, I gotchu." 
    ter "Y'know what cures hangriness? Sushi. At Miya's. Made to order, just for you." 
    "Morgan smiles weakly." 
    ter "Okay girl, okay! I see that smile!"
    morg "It's on the list, so... why not?"
    ter "Exactly! Exactly why not?! Item Two: Eating A Meal Worth... well, worth every bite." 
    ter "We'll get you double servings, okay?" 
    morg "Okay."
    morg "With extra avocado?" 
    ter "The whole orchard, dude. C'mon." 
    #Exit Terrie and Morgan from screen left. 
    "So it was just the three of us for the day." 
    "Finn not being there left a foul taste in my mouth, of course. I think it did for everyone." 
    "But, we hoped, we could wash down the bitter pill with a delicious, fresh banquet of sushi."
