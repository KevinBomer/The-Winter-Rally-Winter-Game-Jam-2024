TERRIE 
Morgan, oh my God, you're glowing! 
MORGAN 
(gentle snicker) 
Not literally, I hope. 
TERRIE 
It's just— wh— how— what kinda 
treatment are they giving you guys in 
here?! 
TERRIE (cont'd) 
It's like a miracle! 
MORGAN 
Who knows? Maybe they hooked me up to 
the Elixir of Life by accident. 
TERRIE 
D'you feel like you could... 
y'know... again? 

What, this? 
MORGAN 
NARRATION 

The moment that Morgan stood up again, it was like she'd never fallen ill. 
(Printed with the demonstration version of Fade In)
6. 
NARRATION (cont'd) 
It was like the future we wished for 
as teenagers could finally come to 
pass. 
TERRIE 
Dude... pinch me right now. 

Okay, then. 
MORGAN TERRIE 

Ow- hey! You KNOW that's a figure of speech, you! 
MORGAN 
(sarcastic) 
Oh, I'm sorry, I've been cut off from the outside world for the past ten months. 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
Who knows how people speak now? 
TERRIE 
Well, since you're up and walkin', we could probably go out and see for ourselves! 

We could... 
Beat. 
MORGAN 
MORGAN (cont'd) 

...Hm. Terrie, see that wastepaper over there in the trash? 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
There's something written on it that I want to show you guys. 
NARRATION 
The wad of paper that Morgan threw away who knows how long ago was actually a to-do list. 
NARRATION (cont'd) 
Packed with fun activities to pass the time with alongside friends across Vancouver. 
(Printed with the demonstration version of Fade In)
7. 
NARRATION (cont'd) 
It was filled top to bottom. And 
Morgan, although she almost gave up 
on it, now... 

All of it. 
Beat. 
MORGAN TERRIE 

All of it? Today? 
MORGAN 
All of it. Today. 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
(increasingly 
skittish) 
With as many people as we can find. Heck, invite the neighbour's dog if you have to. 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
Hey, how are Mina and Finn getting on? 
TERRIE 
Oh, y'know, still giving their careers everything! 
TERRIE (cont'd) 
I dunno if we could reach them... to tell the truth, it's been a while. Like, with a capital W. 
MORGAN 
All the more reason to get them on board. 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
Terrie, this is something we won't have- we haven't had - for ages. 

Well... 
TERRIE 
TERRIE (cont'd) 

I'm sure someone can make the time if we ask nicely! 
MORGAN 
Oh, we'll ask, alright. 
(Printed with the demonstration version of Fade In)
8. 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
You call Finn, I'll get in touch with 
Mina. 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
And, hey, if he's slow to pick up, 
introduce yourself as the pizza guy. 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
You know how he is. 
TERRIE 
Girl, he has our contacts saved. Be 
for real. 
TERRIE (cont'd) 
Oh well, here we go, then! Gimme one 
sec while I just... 
Exit Terrie. 
MORGAN 
(under breath) 
Right, now, my phone. Where oh where 
oh where is— 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
Ah. Right. Only 1% left. 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
You won't mind if I use yours? 
Thanks. 
A dialtone can be heard. Silence while the phone rings. 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
...Hey, what's with that look? 
Further beat. 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
(curt gasp) 
You saw it too, didn't you? 
After some feedback and mic bumping on the other side of the phone, Mina picks up. Pop-in chibi MINA. 
MINA 
—llo? Hello? You there? 
MORGAN 
Mina. It's me, Morgan. I'm here with 
the others. 
(Printed with the demonstration version of Fade In)
9. 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
Well, just Terrie and— 
MINA 
Get outta town, MORGAN?! Girly it's 
been forever! How are things?! 
MINA (cont'd) 
Uh, I mean, outside of the... 
hospital stuff. 
MORGAN 
That's why I'm calling. 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
I've got a day outside to myself, and 
I was thinking of crossing a few 
items off of my to-do list. 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
In the company of whoever I wished. 
MINA 
And you thought of me? D'aww. 
MINA (cont'd) 
What notice period am I lookin' at? 
MORGAN 
None. Obviously. 
Beat. 
MINA 
Man, it really has been a million 
years. 
MINA (cont'd) 
Ugh, how do I put this? for the last 
few months, streaming's gone so well 
that I, uh... 
MINA (cont'd) 
LA called, and I went. Like, for 
good. 
MINA (cont'd) 
Morgan, I really wanna be there, 
like, really really, but with the 
timings and all I don't think I can— 

It's fine. 
MORGAN 

(Printed with the demonstration version of Fade In)
10. 

...you sure? 
MINA 
MORGAN 

Yes, really, Mina. 
MINA 
I can try making changes or something— 

I promise. 
MORGAN 
MORGAN (cont'd) 

Hearing from you's good enough for me. 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
Next time we all want to be in the same place together, you'll know first. 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
And congratulations on the streaming blow-up. You really deserved it. 
MINA 
(sighs) 
Morgan... 
MINA (cont'd) 
You better tell me how things went after today, 'kay? 

You got it. 
MORGAN MINA 

Mhm... listen, uh, I had a stream to set up for like, five minutes ago, so I gotta bounce. 
MORGAN 
No worries! Go to work! 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
Terrie and Finn say hi, too. We'll talk soon. Lots of love from us all. 

(Printed with the demonstration version of Fade In)
MINA 
(hastily) 
Okay thank you guys miss you talk 
later byeeeeeee~! Sorry again bye 
gang. Buh-bye 
Awkward second of Mina's clothes rustling against her phone's microphone before she hangs up. 
11. 

Bye. 
MORGAN 

Emphasis on sudden gloom from Morgan. Enter Terrie from screen right. 
TERRIE 
(frustrated) 
Oh, that guy! 

No luck? 
MORGAN TERRIE 

(blusters) 
Nada. How about Mina? 

... 
MORGAN TERRIE 

Oh, yeah, the career... 
TERRIE (cont'd) 
Well, uh, I'm sure we can make today work with just the three of us! 
MORGAN 
We can. But we won't. 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
A little break from his hardships would do wonders for Finn. I would know. 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
That's why we have to tell him in person. 
MORGAN (cont'd) 
Guys, get out something to write with. I'm amending our master plan. 

(Printed with the demonstration version of Fade In)
MORGAN (cont'd) 
New order, phase one: Make Finn Smile 
Again. 
TERRIE 
I mean, if you can manage a grin, no 
excuses for him! 
Morgan smiles again. 
TERRIE (cont'd) 
EXACTLY! Just like that! 
TERRIE (cont'd) 
Now, if we're kickin' this mission 
off... 
TERRIE (cont'd) 
We gotta go back to school.
