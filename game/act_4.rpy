##SCENE ICE RINK with dissolve
"The ice rink sounded like a good idea on paper, we all thought."
"A quintessentially wintry pastime where all of your friends hit the ice, then skate like a pro or look good trying."
"And whilst some of us couldn't walk straight with blades on the soles of our feet..."
##Suddenly enter TERRIE from screen middle
ter "ACK! Too frozen, too frozen!!"
##Enter MORGAN from screen left.
morg "Give me your hand, Terr."
morg "It's like riding a bike; the faster you move, the less you wobble."
"...others moved like they were raised on ice."
MORGAN 
(content sigh)
Isn't this just the life, everyone? The speed, the wind, the chill all over again.
MORGAN 
Oh, it's just so... so freeing...
##Pop-in FINN.
FINN 
(anxious) 
I have yet to be the judge of that!
FINN 
Excuse me, friend, would you care to provide me with a boost off the wall?
CHOICE 1
[Gently push him]
FINN
Maybe with somewhat more oomph next time— I mean, whee…
TERRIE
(like a commentator)
Ooh, look out, attempting to break the land speed record we have FINN at a BLISTERING
2 kilometers an hour!
MORGAN
(fake gasp)
Oh, how will he and his pit crew ever hope to topple the current defending champion?
FINN
When the defending champion talks like that, perhaps she should let her actions speak
instead.
CHOICE 2
[Link arms and pull him along]
FINN
YIKES! Bold today, are we?!
MORGAN
You'll both bring yourselves down with technique like that!
MORGAN
Oop- (sucks air through teeth)...and there it is. Do you guys need a pair of hands?
FINN
(groans)
Like we need air to breathe.
#beat
Thank you. Now you try zipping forward with such velocity.
CHOICE 3
You're a great friend and you'll kick ass on the ice!
FINN
Enthusiasm appreciated, but wrong kind of boost. I suppose it'll suffice... and we're off.
TERRIE
Attaboy, Finn! Come join me and… Wow, never mind, Morgan's skatin' circles around us already.
FINN
Oh, really? I think she could do better.
#Paths converge
#MORGAN develops a keen smirk.
TERRIE
Uh, dudes, I think you just declared war.
MORGAN
They most certainly did. Hold my gloves, Terrie.
##Exit MORGAN.
TERRIE
I don't think you realize just what you're about to witness.
TERRIE
Remember how much of a beast she was on the ice before... before the—
FINN
I never forgot, don't panic.
TERRIE
Yeah. I'm pretty sure she spent two hours by herself here for every hour we visited as the gang!
TERRIE
I caught the tail end of one of her routines once when I came to get my skates re-sized. It was... really somethin' else.
TERRIE
So prepare for a blown mind with a side of I-told-you-so!
CHOICE 1
We're gonna eat our words, Finn.
FINN
Much like the sushi we dined on prior, I fear.
TERRIE
Dinner
FINN
Time is still on our side, now. Who knows what else we'll see today?
CHOICE 2
Hey, Morgan's just happy to be here. That's a win.
TERRIE
True that! Look at us, cheering our girl on like it's nationals day.
FINN
She really should consider that level of performance if things improve.
TERRIE
Yeah… (awkward pause)
CHOICE 3
What if my mind was pre-blown coming into the rink?
TERRIE
What, by the whole fact that she can actually skate? Fair!
TERRIE 
That and, uh...
TERRIE
(whispering directly to player) You definitely saw it at the hospital, right?
##Enter MORGAN again, this time further away from the others.
MORGAN
(far off) I think we're ready! Are you watching, judges?
TERRIE
Huh? Hey, that's us, we're judges!
TERRIE
Knock 'em dead, Morgan!
##Pause.
TERRIE 
(flustered) I mean, uh, perform with grace and beauty an' all that!
MORGAN
(far off, giggling) I can do both!
FINN
Fantastic! Come on, let's give her some space.
NARRATOR
As the three of us made our way back towards the walls and gave Morgan the thumbs up, the fire in her eyes could have melted every ice rink between here and Montreal.
NARRATOR
But I wondered, did she still have it in her to push this far?
MORGAN
(whispering to herself) Three, two, one, and...
NARRATOR
Her blades kicked ice powder into the air as she started her dance, and the rest was history.
MINIGAME START
## INT. ICE RINK - DAY with dissolve
NARRATOR
History for the sports almanacs, that is.
NARRATOR
I don't think I'd seen so many other ordinary people stop whatever they were doing and just… stare in awe.
NARRATOR
All eyes were on Morgan, just as she deserved. She was like an angel, and the rink was her heaven.
NARRATOR 
An angel whose speed sometimes made her struggle to come to a timely Halt.
##Pop-in MORGAN.
MORGAN
(panicky) Watch it watch it watch it—!!!!
NARRATOR
And who sometimes relied on me as a crash pad.
MORGAN
Oh, gosh, you. Two wipeouts in one session? Sorry, I've got you.
CHOICE 1
You were glowing out there.
MORGAN
Aw, you're just being nice.
TERRIE
Oh c'mon, be less humble; that rink was yours just now!
CHOICE 2
You need to work on your finishes
MORGAN
I guess I do... you won't always be there to cushion the tough blows, will you?
MORGAN
Then again, nothing's a hundred percent perfect right? (melancholy giggle)
CHOICE 3
Fancy a partner dance next time?
MORGAN
(sly giggle) Think you could keep up with me, or will you be waddling like a penguin?
#Beat.
MORGAN 
(much softer) Same time, next month. Save the date, and if you flake I'm snowballing your
house. (laughs)
NARRATOR
Morgan was alive. And it seemed now that she intended to keep it that way.
FINN
Well, there's absolutely no chance of us ever topping that. Stellar performance.
FINN 
You must be exhausted now, though — I know I am.
TERRIE
Yeah, I'm beat, Morgs. Think you're rinked out for the day too?
MORGAN
I guess I am. As for the list, let's change and see what else there is.
##FADE TO BLACK
##FADE IN STREET - DAY with dissolve
##Pop-in TERRIE, MORGAN and FINN.
MORGAN
Alright, next on the agenda.
MORGAN
Who wants to get married?
##Comically long beat.
FINN
In jest, right?
MORGAN
No, for real.
MORGAN
And also for the tax benefits.
MORGAN 
It's right here on the list, see?
Pledge the rest of my life to somebody dear.
TERRIE
(reading) Pledge... life... somebody dear...
(normally) Damn, you really went there!
TERRIE
Well which one of us electable—
FINN
Eligible.
TERRIE
—eligible bachelors are you gonna pick, Ms. Soon-To-Be-Mrs.-Bride?
MORGAN
(cheeky) Hmm... I have a way to weed out the competition.
MORGAN
We're off the the fairgrounds. Last one there's the ordaining minister, three two one go!
#Pop out MORGAN, then TERRIE one second later.
FINN
Hey, unjust competitive ruleset!
NARRATOR
And so, by the power vested in me...
NARRATOR 
I pronounced myself 'Not Coming In Last' and got the heck out of there.
NARRATOR
Unfortunately, it was the kind of history you pray never repeats itself.
NARRATOR
As free as she wanted things to flow, she stumbled and struggled through her routine, like she was chained and puppeteered by something we could never hope to see.
NARRATOR 
And as quickly as she got onto the ice...
NARRATOR
She was off her feet, and at our knees.
MORGAN
(weakly) Ow...
MORGAN (cont'd)
Oh God, everyone saw that, didn't they?
CHOICE 1
It was a good effort. Well done.
MORGAN
Yeah, but... what happened?
MORGAN
I mean, I know what happened, but, just... to me?
MORGAN
I thought I'd gotten better enough to do this again, but I guess everyone has their limits, right? Yeah.
CHOICE 2
Far better than any of us could do, at least!
MORGAN
Thanks.
MORGAN
It feels like they're all staring at me. Do you think they think I'm a tryhard?
MORGAN
Oh, this sucks. This sucks and my butt is frozen and I'm calling time.
##MORGAN looks like she's about to cry.
##Pop-in FINN and TERRIE.
TERRIE
(imitating an
ambulance)
Wee-oo, wee-oo, Terrie to the rescue, nothing to see here, people!
TERRIE
Vamoose! Don't make me call the resurfacer!
FINN
Can you remain standing?
MORGAN
Fortunately yes. Now come on, we have a list to complete.
MORGAN
Full time, or whatever.
FINN
For what it was worth, I loved the routine in spite of, uh...
##MORGAN looks disappointed.
FINN 
Okay, right, never mind, going with haste.
##FADE TO BLACK 
##FADE IN STREET - DAY with dissolve
##Pop-in TERRIE, MORGAN and FINN.
MORGAN
Alright, next on the agenda.
MORGAN 
Oh, phew, this one can't go wrong.
MORGAN 
It's nearly fireworks time.
TERRIE
(squeals) You're kidding! After all these years we're goin' back?!
MORGAN
With a twist.
MORGAN
When was the last time you heard me
scream?
TERRIE
Huh?
FINN
Ohhhh, I see. You aim to yell as loud as you can into the valleys and hear its echo?
MORGAN
You know me so well.
TERRIE
Honestly, girl, I'd get it if you just screamed right now outta nowhere.
MORGAN
Believe me. I've wanted to. That rink nearly never heard the end of it.
MORGAN 
That's why I thought, why not just do it in a place that matters?
TERRIE
Okay, we love a bit'a showmanship!
TERRIE
Let's do it, then. Let's see the pretty lights and wreck our throats for the next week.
FINN
I would prefer to preserve mine, in all honesty.
TERRIE
(cheeky) Your exam a speaking one?
FINN
No, but—
TERRIE
Then we're good! C'mon!!
##MORGAN laughs, and they all exit.
NARRATOR
The day was drawing to a close faster than expected.
NARRATOR
Fortunately, it would end with what we all came out for. (MORE)
NARRATOR
What our hearts all held onto the most for the longest time.
NARRATOR
Our grand day out would for sure end with a bang.
