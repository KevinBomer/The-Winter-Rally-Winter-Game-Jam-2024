    #EXT. CORRIDOR — THE SPOT
    "The next thing on the list was a meal worth dying for. And for that, it would require a restaurant capable of producing such a meal."
    "There was only one place that could have food that was worthy of such a title. One Morgan had listed specifically on the list due to its sheer importance to everyone."
    "A quaint, family-run sushi restaurant called Miya’s that we visited frequently during our high school days. It might have been just another restaurant to some, but to us, this was The Spot."
    "I can’t remember the last time I was here."
    "Long forgotten memories come flooding back to when this place was full of life. However, time was not kind to it, like many things." 
    "Despite the wear and tear, color shines through like a flower under rubble."
